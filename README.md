## Real-Time Web-Based SAR Image Colorization Using Deep Learning
This online platform translates Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images into optical satellite images using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). Users upload SAR images, and a UNet-based generator, guided by a PatchGAN discriminator, produces realistic optical images. 

## About
This project is an advanced online platform that transforms Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images into optical satellite images using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). SAR images, widely used in remote sensing, provide detailed surface information but lack natural visual clarity. By leveraging deep learning techniques, this system generates realistic optical images from SAR inputs, making it easier for researchers and analysts to interpret satellite data. This approach is particularly useful for regions with persistent cloud cover, where optical satellites struggle to capture clear images. The system enhances remote sensing applications by improving data accessibility and usability.

The core model is based on a UNet-based generator, which synthesizes high-quality optical images, and a PatchGAN discriminator, which ensures their realism. The training process combines adversarial loss to enhance image authenticity and L1 loss for pixel-wise accuracy. The implementation is powered by PyTorch, with a backend developed using Flask or FastAPI for seamless online interaction. Users can upload SAR images via a web interface, process them in real time, and visualize the generated optical images. By automating data preprocessing, augmentation, and normalization, the platform ensures high efficiency, making SAR-to-optical image translation more accessible for remote sensing professionals and researchers.
